# Python Project 2024 - Empirical Assessment of Technical Analysis Indicators: High-frequency Data

This project test the performance of technical analysis indicators on trading with 1-minute data. We show that following simple trading strategies based on these indicators can bring substantial profits.

The final notebook contains an overview of selected indicators and their usage. The most important part consists of two fucntions (prepare and backtest) which when combined prepare the raw dataframe and perform the analysis. 

PS: We have not used the Git (GitHub) effectively in the beginning and therefore commits (and their authors) do not adhere to the exact workload distribution.
